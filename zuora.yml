  title: Zuora API Reference
  description: "\n\n# Introduction\nWelcome to the reference for the Zuora REST API!\n\
    \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST_API\" target=\"_blank\">REST</a>\
    \ is a web-service protocol that lends itself to rapid development by using everyday\
    \ HTTP and JSON technology.\n\nThe Zuora REST API provides a broad set of operations\
    \ and resources that:\n\n  * Enable Web Storefront integration from your website.\n\
    \  * Support self-service subscriber sign-ups and account management.\n  * Process\
    \ revenue schedules through custom revenue rule models.\n  * Enable manipulation\
    \ of most objects in the Zuora Object Model.\n\nWant to share your opinion on\
    \ how our API works for you? <a href=\"https://community.zuora.com/t5/Developers/API-Feedback-Form/gpm-p/21399\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">Tell us how you feel </a>about using our API and what we can\
    \ do to make it better.\n\n  ## Endpoints\n  \n  The Zuora REST API is provided\
    \ via the following endpoints.\n  | Tenant              | Base URL for REST Endpoints\
    \ |\n  |-------------------------|-------------------------|\n  |US Production\
    \ | https://rest.zuora.com   |\n  |US API Sandbox    | https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com|\n\
    \  |US Performance Test | https://rest.pt1.zuora.com |\n  |EU Production | https://rest.eu.zuora.com\
    \ |\n  |EU Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com |\n  \n  The production\
    \ endpoint provides access to your live user data. The API Sandbox tenant is a\
    \ good place to test your code without affecting real-world data. To use it, you\
    \ must be provisioned with an API Sandbox tenant - your Zuora representative can\
    \ help you if needed.\n  \n  ## Access to the API\n  \n  If you have a Zuora tenant,\
    \ you already have access to the API.\n  \n  If you don't have a Zuora tenant,\
    \ go to <a href=\"\nhttps://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive\" target=\"\
    _blank\">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign up for a\
    \ Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, such as a sample\
    \ product catalog.\n\nWe recommend that you <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">create an API user</a> specifically for making API calls.\
    \ Don't log in to the Zuora UI with this account. Logging in to the UI enables\
    \ a security feature that periodically expires the account's password, which may\
    \ eventually cause authentication failures with the API. Note that a user role\
    \ does not have write access to Zuora REST services unless it has the API Write\
    \ Access permission as described in those instructions.\n\n\n# API Changelog\n\
    You can find the <a href=\"https://community.zuora.com/t5/Developers/API-Changelog/gpm-p/18092\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">Changelog</a> of the API Reference in the Zuora Community.\n\
    \n\n# Authentication\n\n## OAuth v2.0\n\nZuora recommends that you use OAuth v2.0\
    \ to authenticate to the Zuora REST API. Currently, OAuth is not available in\
    \ every environment. See [Zuora Testing Environments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Environments)\
    \ for more information.\n\nZuora recommends you to create a dedicated API user\
    \ with API write access on a tenant when authenticating via OAuth, and then create\
    \ an OAuth client for this user. By doing this, you can control permissions of\
    \ the API user without affecting other non-API users. Note that if a user is deactivated,\
    \ all his OAuth clients will be automatically deactivated.\n\nAuthenticating via\
    \ OAuth requires the following steps:\n1. Create a Client\n2. Generate a Token\n\
    3. Make Authenticated Requests\n\n### Create a Client\n\nYou must first [create\
    \ an OAuth client](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User)\
    \ in the Zuora UI. To do this, you must be an administrator of your Zuora tenant.\
    \ This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID and a Client\
    \ Secret. Please note this information down, as it will be required for the next\
    \ step.\n\n**Note:** The OAuth client will be owned by a Zuora user account. If\
    \ you want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client,\
    \ the owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the \"\
    API Write Access\" permission.\n\n### Generate a Token\n\nAfter creating a client,\
    \ you must make a call to obtain a bearer token using the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken)\
    \ operation. This operation requires the following parameters:\n- `client_id`\
    \ - the Client ID displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous\
    \ step\n- `client_secret` - the Client Secret displayed when you created the OAuth\
    \ client in the previous step\n- `grant_type` - must be set to `client_credentials`\n\
    \n**Note**: The Client ID and Client Secret mentioned above were displayed when\
    \ you created the OAuth Client in the prior step. The [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken)\
    \ response specifies how long the bearer token is valid for. Call [Generate an\
    \ OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken)\
    \ again to generate a new bearer token.\n\n### Make Authenticated Requests\n\n\
    To authenticate subsequent API requests, you must provide a valid bearer token\
    \ in an HTTP header:\n\n`Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`\n\nIf you have\
    \ [Zuora Multi-entity](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Entities)\
    \ enabled, you need to set an additional header to specify the ID of the entity\
    \ that you want to access. You can use the `scope` field in the [Generate an OAuth\
    \ token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken)\
    \ response to determine whether you need to specify an entity ID.\n\nIf the `scope`\
    \ field contains more than one entity ID, you must specify the ID of the entity\
    \ that you want to access. For example, if the `scope` field contains `entity.1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc`\
    \ and `entity.c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`, specify one of the following\
    \ headers:\n- `Zuora-Entity-Ids: 1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc`\n- `Zuora-Entity-Ids:\
    \ c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`\n\n**Note**: For a limited period of time,\
    \ Zuora will accept the `entityId` header as an alternative to the `Zuora-Entity-Ids`\
    \ header. If you choose to set the `entityId` header, you must remove all \"-\"\
    \ characters from the entity ID in the `scope` field.\n\nIf the `scope` field\
    \ contains a single entity ID, you do not need to specify an entity ID.\n\n\n\
    ## Other Supported Authentication Schemes\n\nZuora continues to support the following\
    \ additional legacy means of authentication:\n\n  * Use username and password.\
    \ Include authentication with each request in the header: \n  \n    * `apiAccessKeyId`\
    \ \n    * `apiSecretAccessKey`\n\n  * Use an authorization cookie. The cookie\
    \ authorizes the user to make calls to the REST API for the duration specified\
    \ in  **Administration > Security Policies > Session timeout**. The cookie expiration\
    \ time is reset with this duration after every call to the REST API. To obtain\
    \ a cookie, call the [Connections](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Connections)\
    \ resource with the following API user information: \n  \n    *   ID    \n   \
    \ *   password\n    \n  * For CORS-enabled APIs only: Include a 'single-use' token\
    \ in the request header, which re-authenticates the user with each request. See\
    \ below for more details.\n\n### Entity Id and Entity Name\n\nThe `entityId` and\
    \ `entityName` parameters are only used for [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity\
    \ \"Zuora Multi-entity\"). These are the legacy parameters that Zuora will only\
    \ continue to support for a period of time. Zuora recommends you to use the `Zuora-Entity-Ids`\
    \ parameter instead.\n\n\nThe  `entityId` and `entityName` parameters specify\
    \ the Id and the [name of the entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/B_Introduction_to_Entity_and_Entity_Hierarchy#Name_and_Display_Name\
    \ \"Introduction to Entity and Entity Hierarchy\") that you want to access, respectively.\
    \ Note that you must have permission to access the entity. \n\nYou can specify\
    \ either the `entityId` or `entityName` parameter in the authentication to access\
    \ and view an entity.\n\n  * If both `entityId` and `entityName` are specified\
    \ in the authentication, an error occurs. \n  * If neither `entityId` nor `entityName`\
    \ is specified in the authentication, you will log in to the entity in which your\
    \ user account is created. \n  \n\nTo get the entity Id and entity name, you can\
    \ use the GET Entities REST call. For more information, see [API User Authentication](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/A_Overview_of_Multi-entity#API_User_Authentication\
    \ \"API User Authentication\").\n  \n  ### Token Authentication for CORS-Enabled\
    \ APIs\n  \n  The CORS mechanism enables REST API calls to Zuora to be made directly\
    \ from your customer's browser, with all credit card and security information\
    \ transmitted directly to Zuora. This minimizes your PCI compliance burden, allows\
    \ you to implement advanced validation on your payment forms, and  makes your\
    \ payment forms look just like any other part of your website.\n  \nFor security\
    \ reasons, instead of using cookies, an API request via CORS uses **tokens** for\
    \ authentication.\n\nThe token method of authentication is only designed for use\
    \ with requests that must originate from your customer's browser; **it should\
    \  not be considered a replacement to the existing cookie authentication** mechanism.\n\
    \nSee [Zuora CORS REST](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/REST_API/A_REST_basics/G_CORS_REST\
    \ \"Zuora CORS REST\") for details on how CORS works and how you can begin to\
    \ implement customer calls to the Zuora REST APIs. See  [HMAC Signatures](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POSTHMACSignature\
    \ \"HMAC Signatures\") for details on the HMAC method that returns the authentication\
    \ token.\n\n# Requests and Responses\n\n## Request IDs \nAs a general rule, when\
    \ asked to supply a \"key\" for an account or subscription (accountKey, account-key,\
    \ subscriptionKey, subscription-key), you can provide either the actual ID or\
    \  the number of the entity.\n\n## HTTP Request Body\n\nMost of the parameters\
    \ and data accompanying your requests will be contained in the body of the HTTP\
    \ request. \n\nThe Zuora REST API accepts JSON in the HTTP request body. No other\
    \ data format (e.g., XML) is supported.\n\n### Data Type\n\n([Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions)\
    \ and CRUD operations only) We recommend that you do not specify the decimal values\
    \ with quotation marks, commas, and spaces. Use characters of `+-0-9.eE`, for\
    \ example, `5`, `1.9`, `-8.469`, and `7.7e2`. Also, Zuora does not convert currencies\
    \ for decimal values.\n\n## Testing a Request\n\nUse a third party client, such\
    \ as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se \"curl\"), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com\
    \ \"Postman\"), or [Advanced REST Client](https://advancedrestclient.com \"Advanced\
    \ REST Client\"), to test the Zuora REST API.\n\nYou can test the Zuora REST API\
    \ from the Zuora API Sandbox or Production tenants. If connecting to Production,\
    \ bear in mind that you are working with your live production data, not sample\
    \ data or test data.\n\n## Testing with Credit Cards\n\nSooner or later it will\
    \ probably be necessary to test some transactions that involve credit cards. For\
    \ suggestions on how to handle this, see [Going Live With Your Payment Gateway](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards\
    \ \"C_Zuora_User_Guides/A_Billing_and_Payments/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards\"\
    \n).\n\n## Concurrent Request Limits\n\nZuora enforces tenant-level concurrent\
    \ request limits. See <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">Concurrent Request Limits</a> for more information.\n\n\n\n\
    ## Error Handling\n\nResponses and error codes are detailed in [Responses and\
    \ errors](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/REST_API/A_REST_basics/3_Responses_and_errors\
    \ \"Responses and errors\").\n\n# Pagination\n\nWhen retrieving information (using\
    \ GET methods), the optional `pageSize` query parameter sets the maximum number\
    \ of rows to return in a response. The maximum is `40`; larger values are treated\
    \ as `40`. If this value is empty or invalid, `pageSize` typically defaults to\
    \ `10`.\n\nThe default value for the maximum number of rows retrieved can be overridden\
    \ at the method level.\n\nIf more rows are available, the response will include\
    \ a `nextPage` element, which contains a URL for requesting the next page.  If\
    \ this value is not provided, no more rows are available. No \"previous page\"\
    \ element is explicitly provided; to support backward paging, use the previous\
    \ call.\n\n## Array Size\n\nFor data items that are not paginated, the REST API\
    \ supports arrays of up to 300 rows.  Thus, for instance, repeated pagination\
    \ can retrieve thousands of customer accounts, but within any account an array\
    \ of no more than 300 rate plans is returned.\n\n# API Versions\n\nThe Zuora REST\
    \ API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are\
    \ backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage\
    \ changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses\
    \ regardless of future changes to the API.\n\n## Major Version\n\nThe major version\
    \ number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently, Zuora only supports\
    \ the **v1** major version. For example, `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.\n\
    \n## Minor Version\n\nZuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small\
    \ changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field\
    \ is used to replace it. \n\nSome fields in the REST methods are supported as\
    \ of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field\
    \ is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version,\
    \ this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version\
    \ in the request header to process without an error. \n\nIf a field is in version\
    \ control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version,\
    \ or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between\
    \ the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the `invoiceCollect`\
    \ field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum\
    \ minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0\
    \ or earlier.\n\nIf you specify a version number in the request header that is\
    \ not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In\
    \ our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number,\
    \ we note that in the field description.\n\nYou only need to specify the version\
    \ number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor\
    \ version, set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the\
    \ request header for the request call. For example, the `collect` field is in\
    \ 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription\
    \ method, set the  `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header.\
    \ The `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.\n\nFor all the REST API fields,\
    \ by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora\
    \ will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration.\
    \ \n\n### Minor Version History\n\nThe supported minor versions are not serial.\
    \ This section documents the changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.\n\
    \nThe following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a\
    \ Zuora REST API minor version.\n\n| Fields         | Minor Version      | REST\

    Actions are operations that are batch in nature. For example, the "create", "update", "delete", and other operations allow changes to up-to 50 objects at a time. The "query" operation will return up-to 2000 result records back at a time, before requiring additional pages of data to be returned via a subsequent "queryMore" operation.

    The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. If you want to change the WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` field in the request header for the request call.

    **Note**: Actions do not support the Advanced AR Settlement feature. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

    The Custom Fields service enables you to manage the custom fields that are defined in your Zuora tenant. You can use the Custom Fields service to define and view the custom fields that are available as part of another service, such as Real-Time Usage Rating. You cannot use the Custom Fields service to access data stored in custom fields; you can only do this via the service that the custom fields are part of.

    The Custom Fields service represents custom fields by "custom fields definitions". Each custom fields definition contains a JSON schema that specifies the names, types, and valid values of the custom fields that are available as part of a service.

    To support custom fields for Zuora objects in addition to newer services, custom fields definitions are arranged into different namespaces. The `zuora` namespace contains custom fields definitions for Zuora objects, such as Account and Contact objects. The global namespace contains custom fields definitions for newer services, such as Real-Time Usage Rating.


    ## Examples
    ### Real-Time Usage Rating

    To view the custom fields that are available as part of Real-Time Usage Rating, use [Get custom fields definition in the global namespace](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_CustomFieldsDefinitionInGlobalNamespace):
    ```
    GET /fields/definitions/Usage
    ```
    The `schema` field in the response body contains the schema for the custom fields. To set or modify the schema, use [Set schema of custom fields definition in the global namespace](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_CustomFieldsDefinitionInGlobalNamespace):
    ```
    PUT /fields/definitions/Usage
    ```

    ### Contact Object

    To view the custom fields that are available on Contact objects, use [Get custom fields definition in namespace](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_CustomFieldsDefinitionInNamespace):
    ```

        Prerequisites
        -------------
        You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant. You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user permissions.

        Limitations
        -----------
        * The accounting period cannot already be closed.
        * The accounting period cannot be in the process of running a trial balance.
        * All earlier accounting periods must be closed.
        * There must be no required action items for the accounting period. See Reconcile Transactions Before Closing an Accounting Period for more information.

        Notes
        -----
        When you close an accounting period in Zuora, a trial balance is automatically run for that period. A successful response means only that the accounting period is now closed, but does not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed.

        -------------
        * You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant.
        * You must have the Create Accounting Period user permission.

        Limitations
        -----------
        * When creating the first accounting period on your tenant, the start date must be equal to or earlier than the date of the earliest transaction on the tenant.
        * Start and end dates of accounting periods must be contiguous. For example, if one accounting period ends on January 31, the next period must start on February 1.
        * If you have the Revenue Recognition Package and have enabled the "Monthly recognition over time" revenue recognition model, the accounting period start date and end date must be on the first day and last day of the month, respectively. Note that the start and end dates do not necessarily have to be in the same month.

        Updates an accounting period.

        Prerequisites
        -------------

        * You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant.

        * You must have the Create Accounting Period user permission. See [Finance Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/f_Finance_Roles).

        Limitations
        -----------

        * You can update the start date of only the earliest accounting period on your tenant. You cannot update the start date of later periods.

        * If you update the earliest accounting period, the start date must be equal to or earlier than the date of the earliest transaction on the tenant.

        * Start and end dates of accounting periods must be contiguous. For example, if one accounting period ends on January 31, the next period must start on February 1.

        * If you have the Revenue Recognition Package and have enabled the "Monthly recognition over time" revenue recognition model, the accounting period start date and end date must be on the first day and last day of the month, respectively. Note that the start and end dates do not necessarily have to be in the same month.

        * You cannot update the start date or end date of an accounting period if:
          * Any revenue has been distributed into the period.
          * The period has any active journal entries.

      summary: Create account
      operationId: POST_Account
      description: "This REST API reference describes how to create a customer account\
        \ with a credit-card payment method, a bill-to contact, and an optional sold-to\
        \ contact. Request and response field descriptions and sample code are provided.\
        \ Use this method to optionally create a subscription, invoice for that subscription,\
        \ and collect payment through the default payment method. The transaction\
        \ is atomic; if any part fails for any reason, the entire transaction is rolled\
        \ back.\n\nThis API call is CORS Enabled, so you can use client-side Javascript\
        \ to invoke the call. \n\n## Notes\n1. The account is created in active status.\
        \  \n2. The request must provide either a **creditCard** structure or the\
        \ **hpmCreditCardPaymentMethodId** field (but not both). The one provided\
        \ becomes the default payment method for this account. If the credit card\
        \ information is declined or can't be verified, then the account is not created.\n\
        3. Customer accounts created with this call are automatically be set to Auto\
        \ Pay.\n4. If either the **workEmail** or **personalEmail** are specified,\
        \ then the account's email delivery preference is automatically set to `true`.\
        \ (In that case, emails go to the **workEmail** address, if it exists, or\
        \ else the **personalEmail**.) If neither field is specified, the email delivery\
        \ preference is automatically set to `false`.\n5. You cannot use this operation\
        \ to create subscriptions if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders\
        \ Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance)\
        \ for more information.\n\n## Defaults for customerAcceptanceDate and serviceActivationDate\n\
        Default values for **customerAcceptanceDate** and **serviceActivationDate**\
        \ are set as follows.\n\n|        | serviceActivationDate(SA) specified  \
        \        | serviceActivationDate (SA) NOT specified  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\
        \ -----:|\n| customerAcceptanceDate (CA) specified      | SA uses value in\
        \ the request call; CA uses value in the request call| CA uses value in the\
        \ request call;SA uses CE as default |\n| customerAcceptanceDate (CA) NOT\
        \ specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses SA as default\
        \ |   SA and CA use CE as default |\n"

        This REST API reference describes how to update a customer account by specifying the account-key.

        ## Notes
        1. Only the fields to be changed should be specified.  Any field that's not included in the request body will not be changed.
        2. If an empty field is submitted with this call, the corresponding field in the account is emptied.
        3. Email addresses: If no email addresses are specified, no change is made to the email addresses on file or to the email delivery preference. If either the **personalEmail** or **workEmail** is specified (or both), the system updates the corresponding email address(es) on file and the email delivery preference is set to `true`. (In that case, emails go to the **workEmail** address, if it exists, or else the **personalEmail**.) On the other hand, if as a result of this call both of the email addresses for the account are empty, the email delivery preference is set to `false`.
        4. The bill-to and sold-to contacts are separate data entities; updating either one does not update the other.

      description: "Use the create call to create one or more objects of a specific\
        \ type. You can specify different types in different create calls, but each\
        \ create call must apply to only one type of object.\n\n## Limits\n\n### Objects\
        \ per Call\n\n50 objects are supported in a single call.\n\n\n\n## How to\
        \ Use this Call\n\nYou can call create on an array of one or more zObjects.\
        \ It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of\
        \ creating each object. The following information applies to this call:\n\n\
        * You cannot pass in null zObjects.\n* You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects\
        \ at a time.\n* All objects must be of the same type.\n\n### Using Create\
        \ and Subscribe Calls \nBoth the create and subscribe calls will create a\
        \ new account. However, there are differences between the calls.\n\nUse the\
        \ create call to create an account independent of a subscription.\n\nUse the\
        \ subscribe call to create the account with the subscription and the initial\
        \ payment information.\n"

        Generates an on-demand invoice for a specific customer. This is similar to creating an ad-hoc bill run for a specific customer account in the Zuora UI.

        * Supported objects: Invoice
        * Asynchronous process: yes

        The ID of the generated invoice is returned in the response. If multiple invoices are generated, only the id of the first invoice generated is returned. This occurs when an account has multiple subscriptions with the [invoice subscription separately](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Subscriptions/B_Creating_Subscriptions/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately) option enabled.

        Use queryMore to request additional results from a previous query call. If your initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use queryMore to query for the additional results.


        Any `queryLocator` results greater than 2,000, will only be stored by Zuora for 5 days before it is deleted.


         This call sends a request for additional results from an initial query call. If the initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use the `queryLocator` returned from query to request the next set of results.


        **Note:** Zuora expires queryMore cursors after 15 minutes of activity.


        To use queryMore, you first construct a query call. By default, the query call will return up to 2000 results. If there are more than 2000 results, query will return a boolean `done`, which will be marked as `false`, and a `queryLocator`, which is a marker you will pass to queryMore to get the next set of results.

  /v1/action/subscribe:
    post:
      summary: Subscribe
      operationId: Action_POSTsubscribe
      description: "\nThis call performs many actions.  Use the subscribe call to\
        \ bundle information required to create at least one new subscription.\n\n\
        **Note:** This feature is unavailable if you have the Orders feature enabled.\
        \ See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance)\
        \ for more information.\n\nThe call takes in an array of SubscribeRequests.\
        \ Because it takes an array, you can submit a batch of subscription requests\
        \ at once. You can create up to 50 different subscriptions in a single subscribe\
        \ call.\n\nThis is a combined call that you can use to perform all of the\
        \ following tasks in a single call:\n\n* Create accounts\n* Create contacts\n\
        * Create payment methods, including external payment options\n* Create an\
        \ invoice for the subscription\n* Apply the first payment to a subscription\n\
        \n## Object Limits \n50 objects are supported in a single call.\n\n\n\n##\
        \ Effective Date\nIf the effective date is in the future, the invoices will\
        \ not be generated, and there will be no invoice number.\n\n## Subscription\
        \ Name, Number, and ID \n### Subscription Name and Number \nThe subscription\
        \ name is a unique identifier for the subscription. If you do not specify\
        \ a value for the name, Zuora will create one automatically. The automatically\
        \ generated value is known as the subscription number, such as `A-S00000080`.\
        \ You cannot change the subscription name or number after creating the subscription.\
        \ \n\n* **Subscription name**: The name that you set for the subscription.\n\
        * **Subscription number**: The value generated by Zuora automatically if you\
        \ do not specify a subscription name. \n\nBoth the subscription name and number\
        \ must be unique. If they are not, an error will occur.\n\n### Subscription\
        \ ID \nThe subscription ID is a 32-digit ID in the format 4028xxxx. This is\
        \ also the unique identifier for a subscription. This value is automatically\
        \ generated by the system and cannot be edited or updated, but it can be queried.\
        \ One subscription can have only one subscription name or number, but it can\
        \ have multiple IDs: Each version of a subscription has a different ID.\n\n\
        The Subscription object contains the fields `OriginalId` and `PreviousSubscriptionId`.\
        \ `OriginalId` is the ID for the first version of a subscription. `PreviousSubscriptionId`\
        \ is the ID of the version created immediately prior to the current version.\n\
        \n## Subscription Preview \nYou can preview invoices that would be generated\
        \ by the subscribe call. \n\n## Invoice Subscriptions Separately\nIf you have\
        \ enabled the invoice subscriptions separately feature, a subscribe call will\
        \ generate an invoice for each subscription for every subscription where the\
        \ field `IsInvoiceSeparate` is set to `true`.\n\nIf the invoice subscriptions\
        \ separately feature is disabled, a subscribe call will generate a single\
        \ invoice for all subscriptions.\n\nSee [Invoicing Subscriptions Separately](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Subscriptions/B_Creating_Subscriptions/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately)\
        \ for more information.\n\n## Subscriptions and Draft Invoices \nIf a draft\
        \ invoice that includes charges exists in a customer account, using the subscribe\
        \ call to create a new subscription and generate an invoice will cause the\
        \ new subscription to be added to the existing draft invoice. Zuora will then\
        \ post the invoice. \n\n## When to Use Subscribe and Create Calls \nYou can\
        \ use either the subscribe call or the create call to create the objects associated\
        \ with a subscription (accounts, contacts, and so on). There are differences\
        \ between these calls, however, and some situations are better for one or\
        \ the other.\n\n### Use the Subscribe Call \nThe subscribe call bundles up\
        \ all the information you need for a subscription. Use the subscribe call\
        \ to create new subscriptions when you have all the information you need.\n\
        \nSubscribe calls cannot update BillTo, SoldTo, and Account objects. Payment\
        \ information objects cannot be updated if there is an existing account ID\
        \ in the call. These objects are not supported in a subscribe call.\n\n###\
        \ Use the Create Call \nThe create call is more useful when you want to develop\
        \ in stages. For example, if you want to first create an account, then a contact,\
        \ and so on. If you do not have all information available, use the create\
        \ call. To create a subscription, you must activate the account from Draft\
        \ status to Active by calling the subscribe call.\n"

        * You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.\n* All objects must\

        \ example, if an optional field is spelled incorrectly or a field that does\

        You can run up to 10 billing previews in batches concurrently. A single batch of customer accounts can only have one billing preview run at a time. So you can have up to 10 batches running at the same time. If you create a billing preview run for all customer batches, you cannot create another billing preview run until this preview run is completed.

        \ recommends you to use [OAuth](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Authentication/OAuth-v2.0)\
        \ for authentication instead. \n\nThis call authenticates the user and returns\
        \ an API session cookie that's used to authorize subsequent calls to the REST\
        \ API. The credentials must belong to a user account that has permission to\
        \ access the API service.\n\nAs noted elsewhere, it's strongly recommended\
        \ that an account used for Zuora API activity is never used to log into the\
        \ Zuora UI.  Once an account is used to log into the UI, it may be subject\
        \ to periodic forced password changes, which may eventually lead to authentication\
        \ failures when using the API.\n"

      description: |
        You cannot use [Set schema of custom fields definition in the global namespace](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_CustomFieldsDefinitionInGlobalNamespace) to set an empty schema. If you want to set an empty schema, you must use this operation instead.

        Before calling this operation, you must delete all data stored in the custom fields. To delete all data stored in custom fields that are part of part of Real-Time Usage Rating, use [Delete usage by ID](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/DELETE_UsageRecord).

        When you delete the schema of a custom fields definition, Zuora sets `"schema": {}` and `"type": "_internal"` for the custom fields definition.

          The schema for the custom fields definition. The schema must be non-empty. If you want to set an empty schema, use [Delete schema of custom fields definition in namespace](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/DELETE_CustomFieldsDefinitionInNamespace) instead.

          If the namespace is not `zuora`, the schema must conform to the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/specification.html) specification.

          If the namespace is `zuora`, the schema is based on draft-04 of the JSON Schema specification, but has the following Zuora-specific requirements:

          * The schema must have `"type": "object"`.
          * Each property in the schema must contain a string keyword called `label`. The value of `label` specifies the name of the property in the Zuora user interface.
          * The schema may contain an array keyword called `readOnlyOnUI`. The value of `readOnlyOnUI` specifies which properties can be modified by users in the Zuora user interface.
          * The schema may contain an array keyword called `indexed`. The value of `indexed` specifies which properties are indexed for improved performance. Non-indexed properties are functionally identical to indexed properties, but have lower performance. You can specify up to 10 indexed properties.

      description: |
        You cannot use [Set schema of custom fields definition in namespace](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_CustomFieldsDefinitionInNamespace) to set an empty schema. If you want to set an empty schema, you must use this operation instead.

        **Warning:**  If the namespace is `zuora`, this operation also deletes all data stored in the custom fields. Use caution when calling this operation.

        When you delete the schema of a custom fields definition, Zuora sets `"schema": {}` and `"type": "_internal"` for the custom fields definition.

        \ `text`, `timestamp`, and `ZOQL`. If the data type is `picklist`, the `<field>`\
        \ element contains an `<options>` element that lists the possible values of\
        \ the field.    |\n| `<contexts>` | Specifies the availability of the field.\
        \ If the `<contexts>` element lists the `export` context, the field is available\
        \ for use in data source exports.                                        \
        \                                                                        \
        \                                |\n\nThe `<field>` element contains other\
        \ elements that provide legacy information about the field. This information\
        \ is not directly related to the REST API.\n\nResponse sample:\n```xml\n<?xml\
        \ version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<object>\n  <name>ProductRatePlanCharge</name>\n\
        \  <label>Product Rate Plan Charge</label>\n  <fields>\n    ...\n    <field>\n\
        \      <name>TaxMode</name>\n      <label>Tax Mode</label>\n      <type>picklist</type>\n\
        \      <options>\n        <option>TaxExclusive</option>\n        <option>TaxInclusive</option>\n\

        \     </contexts>\n      ...\n    </field>\n    ...\n  </fields>\n</object>\n\
        ```\n\nIt is strongly recommended that your integration checks `<contexts>`\
        \ elements in the response. If your integration does not check `<contexts>`\
        \ elements, your integration may process fields that are not available for\
        \ use in data source exports. See [Changes to the Describe API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL/Changes_to_the_Describe_API)\

        Retrieve a file by specifying its file ID. You can retrieve accounting period reports, such as the Revenue Detail report, as well as other files such as invoice PDFs.

        ## Example

        ```curl
        curl -i -k -H "apiAccessKeyId:$USER_NAME" -H "apiSecretAccessKey:$PASSWORD"
        -H "Accept:application/pdf"

        -o /Users/jsmith/Downloads/invoiceFile1.pdf
        ```
        The invoice PDF is downloaded to /Users/jsmith/Downloads and named invoiceFile1.pdf.

        ## File Size Limitation
        The maximum export file size is 2047MB. If you have large data requests that go over this limit, you will get the following 403 HTTP response code from Zuora.

        `<security:max-object-size>2047MB</security:max-object-size>`

        Submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://zuora.zendesk.com/agent/) if you require additional assistance.

        We can work with you to determine if large file optimization is an option for you.

        The following are the version-specific and general REST requests for Payment Pages:

        * The request for Payment Pages 1.0 configuration information: `GET <BaseURL>/hostedpages?version=1`
        * The request for Payment Pages 2.0 configuration information: `GET <BaseURL>/hostedpages?version=2`
        * The request for all versions of Payment Pages configuration information: `GET <BaseURL>/hostedpages`

        ## Notes
        If you do not have the corresponding tenant setting enabled, e.g., the request `version` parameter set to 2 with the Payment Pages 2.0 setting disabled, you will receive an error.

        ## Notes
          - You must activate the **Manual Email For Invoice | Manual Email For Invoice** notification before emailing invoices. To include the invoice PDF in the email, select the **Include Invoice PDF** check box in the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. See [Create and Edit Notifications](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/C_Create_Notifications#section_2) for more information.


          - Zuora sends the email messages based on the email template you set. You can set the email template to use in the **Delivery Options** panel of the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. By default, the **Invoice Posted Default Email Template** template is used. See [Create and Edit Email Templates](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/Create_Email_Templates) for more information.


          - The invoices are sent only to the work email addresses or personal email addresses of the Bill To contact if the following conditions are all met:

            * The `useEmailTemplateSetting` field is set to `false`.
            * The email addresses are not specified in the `emailAddresses` field.

      description: "This reference describes how to cancel a journal run using the\
        \ REST API.\n          \nThe summary journal entries in the journal run are\
        \ canceled asynchronously. See the \"Example\" section below for details.\n\
        \          \nYou must have the \"Cancel Journal Run\" Zuora Finance user permission\
        \ enabled to cancel journal runs.\n\n## Notes\nWhen you cancel a journal run,\
        \ the summary journal entries associated with that journal run are canceled\
        \ asynchronously. A response of `{ \"success\": true }` means only that the\
        \ specified journal run has a status of \"Pending\", \"Error\", or \"Completed\"\
        \ and therefore can be canceled, but does not mean that the whole journal\
        \ run was successfully canceled.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to cancel\
        \ journal run JR-00000075. The journal run status is \"Completed\" and it\
        \ contains ten journal entries. One of the journal entries has its Transferred\
        \ to Accounting status set to \"Yes\", meaning that the entry cannot be canceled.\
        \ The workflow might go as follows:\n1. You make an API call to cancel the\
        \ journal run.\n2. The journal run status is \"Completed\", so you receive\
        \ a response of `{ \"success\": true }`.\n3. Zuora begins asynchronously canceling\
        \ journal entries associated with the journal run. The journal entry whose\
        \ Transferred to Accounting status is \"Yes\" fails to be canceled. The cancelation\
        \ process continues, and the other journal entries are successfully canceled.\n\
        4. The journal run status remains as \"Completed\". The status does not change\
        \ to \"Canceled\" because the journal run still contains a journey entry that\
        \ is not canceled.\n"

        This reference describes how to stop a mass action through the REST API. You can stop a mass action when its status is Pending or Processing. After you have stopped a mass action, you can get the mass action result to see details of the mass action.

        - If you stop a mass action when its status is Pending, no response file is generated because no records have been processed.

        - If you stop a mass action when its status is Processing, a response file is generated. You can check the response file to see which records have been processed and which have not. In the response file, the **Success** column has the value `Y` (successful) or `N` (failed) for processed records, and a blank value for unprocessed records.

        Records that have already been processed when a mass action is stopped are not rolled back.

        Sends an authorization request to the corresponding payment gateway to verify the payment method, even though no changes are made for the payment method. Supported payment methods are Credit Cards and Paypal.

        Zuora now supports performing a standalone zero dollar verification or one dollar authorization for credit cards. It also supports a billing agreement status check on PayPal payment methods.

        If a payment method is created by Hosted Payment Pages and is not assigned to any billing account, the payment method cannot be verified through this operation.

      description: "Use this call to make the following kinds of changes to a subscription:\n\
        \  * Add a note\n  * Change the renewal term or auto-renewal flag\n  * Change\
        \ the term length or change between evergreen and termed\n  * Add a new product\
        \ rate plan\n  * Remove an existing subscription rate plan\n  * Change the\
        \ quantity or price of an existing subscription rate plan\n\n## Notes\n* This\
        \ feature is unavailable if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders\
        \ Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance)\
        \ for more information.\n* The Update Subscription call creates a new subscription,\
        \ which has the old subscription number but a new subscription ID.  The old\
        \ subscription is canceled but remains in the system.\n* In one request, this\
        \ call can make:\n  * Up to 9 combined add, update, and remove changes\n \
        \ * No more than 1 change to terms & conditions\n* Updates are performed in\
        \ the following sequence:\n  1. First change the notes on the existing subscription,\
        \ if requested.\n  2. Then change the terms and conditions, if requested.\n\
        \  3. Then perform the remaining amendments based upon the effective dates\
        \ specified. If multiple amendments have the same contract-effective dates,\
        \ then execute adds before updates, and updates before removes.\n* The update\
        \ operation is atomic. If any of the updates fails, the entire operation is\
        \ rolled back.\n* The response of the Update Subscription call is based on\
        \ the REST API minor version you set in the request header. The response structure\
        \ might be different if you use different minor version numbers. \n* If you\
        \ have the Advanced AR Settlement feature enabled, we recommend that you set\
        \ the `zuora-version` parameter to `207.0` or later. Otherwise, an error is\
        \ returned.\n\n## Override a Tiered Price\nThere are two ways you override\
        \ a tiered price:\n\n* Override a specific tier number\nFor example: `tiers[{tier:1,price:8},{tier:2,price:6}]`\n\
        \n* Override the entire tier structure\nFor example:  `tiers[{tier:1,price:8,startingUnit:1,endingUnit:100,priceFormat:\"\
        FlatFee\"},\n{tier:2,price:6,startingUnit:101,priceFormat:\"FlatFee\"}]`\n\
        \nIf you just override a specific tier, do not include the `startingUnit`\
        \ field in the request.\n"

      description: |
        This REST API reference describes how to manually create a summary journal entry. Request and response field descriptions and sample code are provided.
        ## Requirements
        1.The sum of debits must equal the sum of credits in the summary journal entry.

        2.The following applies only if you use foreign currency conversion:
          * If you have configured Aggregate transactions with different currencies during a Journal Run to "Yes", the value of the **currency** field must be the same as your tenant's home currency. That is, you must create journal entries using your home currency.
          * All journal entries in an accounting period must either all be aggregated or all be unaggregated. You cannot have a mix of aggregated and unaggregated journal entries in the same accounting period.

      summary: Post usage
      operationId: POST_Usage
      description: "\nThis REST API reference describes how to post or import usage\
        \ data for one or more accounts in the CSV  format. There are no path or query\
        \ parameters. The data is uploade using the HTTP multipart/form-data POST\
        \ method and applied to the user's tenant. \n\n## How this REST API Call Works\n\
        The content of the upload file must follow the format used by the UI import\
        \ tool. It must be a comma-separated (CSV) file with a corresponding .csv\
        \ extension. The length of the file name must not exceed 50 characters. The\
        \ file size must not exceed 4MB. Click [here](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/@api/deki/files/4105/UsageFileFormat.csv)\
        \ to download the usage file template.\n\nAt the completion of the upload,\
        \ before actually processing the file contents, theAPI returns a response\
        \ containing the byte count of the received file and a URL for checking the\
        \ status of the import process.  Of the five possible results displayed at\
        \ that URL Pending, Processing, Completed, Canceled, and Failed) only a Completed\
        \ status indicates that the import was successful.  The operation is atomic;\
        \ if any record fails, the file is rejected.  In that case, the entire import\
        \ is rolled back and all stored data is returned to its original state.\n\n\
        To view the actual import status, enter the resulting status URL from the\
        \ checkImportStatus response using a tool such as POSTMAN.This additional\
        \ step provides more information about why the import may have failed.\n\n\
        To manage the information after a successful upload, use the web-based UI.\n\
        \n## Upload File Format\nThe upload file uses the following headings:\n\n\
        | Heading         | Description   | Required |\n|-----------------|--------|----------|\n\
        | ACCOUNT_ID      | Enter the account number, e.g., the default account number,\
        \ such as A00000001, or your custom account number.,Although this field is\
        \ labeled as Account_Id, it is not the actual Account ID nor Account Name.\
        \  | Yes      |\n| UOM             | Enter the unit of measure. This must\
        \ match the UOM for the usage. | Yes      |\n| QTY             | Enter the\
        \ quantity.  | Yes      |\n| STARTDATE       | Enter the start date of the\
        \ usage.,This date determines the invoice item service period the associated\
        \ usage is billed to. Date format is based on locale of the current user.\
        \ Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY` | Yes      |\n| ENDDATE         | Enter\
        \ the end date of the usage.,This is not used in calculations for usage billing\
        \ and is optional. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default\
        \ date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`    | Yes      |\n| SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Enter the\
        \ subscription number or subscription name. If you created the subscription\
        \ in the Zuora application, Zuora created a number automatically in a format\
        \ similar to A-S00000001. If you do not provide a value for this field, the\
        \ associated usage will be added to all subscriptions for the specified Account\
        \ that use this Unit Of Measure. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions\
        \ and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify\
        \ the Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record.  | Yes      |\n| CHARGE_ID\
        \       | Enter the charge number (not the charge name). You can see the charge\
        \ ID, e.g., C-00000001, when you add your rate plan to your subscription and\
        \ view your individual charges. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions\
        \ and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify\
        \ the specific Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. This field\
        \ is related to the Charge Number on the subscription rate plan.         \
        \              | Yes      |\n| DESCRIPTION     | Enter a description for the\
        \ charge. | No       |\n"

        * This feature is unavailable if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance) for more information.
        * This operation has some limitations. If you do not have the Orders feature enabled, Zuora recommends that you use [Update subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_Subscription) to amend subscriptions. If you need to create an Amendment object, Zuora recommends that you use [Amend](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Action_POSTamend) instead of CRUD: Create Amendment.

        \ wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com).\
        \ \n\n\n## Post a Bill Run\n\nPosting a bill run is an asynchronous operation.\
        \ To post a bill run, the current bill run must have a status of `Completed`.\n\
        \nWhen a bill run is posted, its status is changed to `PostInProgress`. Once\
        \ all invoices for this bill run are posted then its status is changed to\
        \ `Posted`.   \n\nWhen you post a bill run and query the status of a bill\
        \ run, you will get one of the following results `PostInProgress`, `Completed`,\
        \ or `Posted`. If all invoices in the bill run are posted, then the status\
        \ of the bill run is `Posted`. If one or more invoices fail to post, the status\
        \ will change back to `Completed` and you will need to post the bill run again.\n\
        \n## Cancel a Bill Run\n\nCanceling a bill run is an asynchronous operation.\
        \ When canceling a bill run, the logic is the same as when using the UI to\
        \ cancel a bill run. You need to provide the `BillRunId`, and set the Status\
        \ to `Canceled`. \n\nWhen canceling a bill run, consider the following:\n\n\
        * Canceling a bill run with a `Completed` status.\n  * Only the current bill\
        \ run will be canceled.\n* Canceling a bill run with a `Pending` status.\n\
        \  * When canceling an Ad-hoc bill run, only the current bill run will be\
        \ canceled.\n  * When canceling a scheduled bill, all scheduled bill runs\
        \ will be canceled.\n\nThe Cancel operation may not be successful. Its success\
        \ depends on its current business validation. Only a bill run that has no\
        \ posted invoices can be canceled. If any posted invoices belong to the bill\
        \ run then an invalid value exception will be thrown with the message, \"\
        The Bill Run cannot be Cancelled, There are Posted invoices.\"\n"

        This REST API reference describes how to retrieve a Payment Method Snapshot.

        A Payment Method Snapshot is a copy of the particular Payment Method used in a transaction. If the Payment Method is deleted, the Payment Method Snapshot continues to retain the data used in each of the past transactions.

        ## Notes
        The following Payment Method fields are not available in Payment Method Snapshots:

        * `Active`
        * `AchAddress1`
        * `AchAddress2`
        * `CreatedById`
        * `CreatedDate`
        * `UpdatedById`
        * `UpdatedDate`

        The Payment Method Snapshot field `PaymentMethodId` is not available in Payment Methods.

          If the namespace is not `zuora`, the schema conforms to draft-04 of the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/specification.html) specification.

          If the namespace is `zuora`, the schema is based on draft-04 of the JSON Schema specification, but has the following Zuora-specific features:

          * The schema has `"type": "object"`.
          * Each property in the schema contains a string keyword called `label`. The value of `label` specifies the name of the property in the Zuora user interface.
          * The schema contains an array keyword called `readOnlyOnUI`. The value of `readOnlyOnUI` specifies which properties can be modified by users in the Zuora user interface.
          * The schema contains an array keyword called `indexed`. The value of `indexed` specifies which properties are indexed for improved performance. Non-indexed properties are functionally identical to indexed properties, but have lower performance.
